${project.name}

  This plugin provides the ability to run Ant tasks from within Maven. You can
  even embed your Ant scripts in the POM!

  It is <not> the intention of this plugin to provide a means of polluting the
  POM, so it's encouraged to move all your Ant tasks to a <<<build.xml>>> file
  and just call it from the POM using Ant's
  {{{https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/ant.html}\<ant/\> task}}.

  One of the main purposes of this plugin is to facilitate the migration from Ant
  based projects to Maven. Some projects may not currently be able to migrate
  because they depend on custom build functionality that Maven doesn't provide
  by default.

* Goals Overview

  * {{{./run-mojo.html}antrun:run}} runs Ant tasks for Maven.

* Major Version Upgrade to version 3.0.0

  Please note that the following parameters have been completely removed from the plugin configuration:

   * <<<tasks>>>: use <<<target>>> instead;

   * <<<sourceRoot>>> and <<<testSourceRoot>>>: you can use the 
   {{{https://www.mojohaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/}build-helper-maven-plugin}} instead, with its 
   {{{https://www.mojohaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/add-source-mojo.html}add-source}} and 
   {{{https://www.mojohaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/add-test-source-mojo.html}add-test-source}} goals.

  The format <<<maven.dependency.groupId.artifactId[.classifier].type.path>>> to reference the path of a project
  dependency as an Ant property has been removed: use <<<groupId:artifactId:type[:classifier]>>> instead.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the AntRun Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.

  Plugin, you can take a look into the following examples:
